Shopify Search By Make Model and Years for the car's build within the theme using metafields with Shopify 2.0 filters

To make the filters work you should have the Shopify 2.0 filters app working in the store. 
You need to create a product metafield with name filter and option of multi select
In that filter metafild you have to add the Make Model and Years  split with the | symbol 
For the years you can add the year range separayed with ~ symbol 

So the make model and year range in the filter metafield will look something like 

Honda|Civic|2001~2006

Toyota|Corolla|2018~2023

This section can be added in the home page and after user have selected the Make Model and Year it will redirect them to the collections page with filtered result.
